If the surplus is short of 15%, owners will be required to bear the running costs out of pocket. If the surplus is above 15%, the balance is credited to the owner.</p>

                        Yes, you can find a tenant for your property, but the tenant must be on-boarded by Small Small if the property was purchased with BuySmallSmall financing and there is an outstanding balance unpaid. If the property was purchased outrightly or you’ve cleared all debt on the property, then you’re at liberty to put a tenant anytime and charge any price, but then the rent won’t be guaranteed anymore. We only give guaranteed rent, at our set price, to landlords whose tenants came through us or processed by us..
